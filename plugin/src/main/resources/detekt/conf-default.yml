# Default Detekt configuration
# See https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/style for available rules and configuration options.

# You can activate or deactivate rule sets, configure rule properties,
# and define build failure thresholds here.

# Example:
# style:
#   MaxLineLength:
#     active: true
#     maxLineLength: 120
#   MagicNumber:
#     active: false

# For a starting point, you might want to enable a few rule sets:
# style:
#   active: true
# comments:
#   active: true
# empty-blocks:
#   active: true
# exceptions:
#   active: true
# naming:
#   active: true
# performance:
#   active: true
# potential-bugs:
#   active: true

# Ensure to check the Detekt documentation for the latest configuration options.
# This file can be overridden by providing a custom detekt-config.yml in the project.
